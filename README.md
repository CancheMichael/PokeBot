# Pokedex Messaging Bot built using Twilio Hub on Stdlib/Autocode

# DALI

This project was created for the DALI Lab API Code Challenge.

This project is a proof of concept that incorporates PokeApi https://pokeapi.co/
and Twilio https://www.twilio.com/.
Hosting is provided by https://autocode.com/manage/apps/.
This is the first time I have used either PokeApi, Twilio, or Autocode.
Because it is running the free tiers of Twilio and Autocode, messages are
marked with Twilio trial information. Additionally, there is a cap on the number
of requests possible.
Another limitation of the free tiers is that a phone numbers needs to be
manually approved to be visible by the Twilio service. Pictures of the results are
included as an alternative.

A majority of the code was autogenerated using StdLib's package manager.
My work was implementing the PokeApi to work with StdLib.
Code can be found in functions folder.
